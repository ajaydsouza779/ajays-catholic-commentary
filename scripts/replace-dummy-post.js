        <p><strong>11</strong> On the way to Jerusalem he was going through the region between Samaria and Galilee.</p>

        <p><strong>14</strong> When he saw them, he said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were made clean.</p>
        <p><strong>15</strong> Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice.</p>
        <p><strong>16</strong> He prostrated himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him. And he was a Samaritan.</p>
        <p><strong>17</strong> Then Jesus asked, "Were not ten made clean? But the other nine, where are they?</p>
        <p><strong>18</strong> Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"</p>

        This passage occurs during Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, a significant period in His ministry. The story takes place in the border region between Samaria and Galilee, highlighting the cultural and religious tensions of the time.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Leprosy in Ancient Times:</strong> Leprosy was not just a physical condition but carried deep social and religious implications. Those with leprosy were considered unclean and were required to live apart from society, calling out "Unclean!" when others approached.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Samaritan-Jewish Relations:</strong> The presence of a Samaritan among the lepers is significant. Samaritans and Jews had a long history of mutual hostility, making the Samaritan's return to thank Jesus even more remarkable.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Priestly Verification:</strong> The instruction to "show yourselves to the priests" follows the Mosaic law (Leviticus 14), which required priestly verification of healing before reintegration into society.

  <div class="prose prose-amber max-w-none">
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      This Gospel passage invites us to reflect on the profound nature of gratitude and its transformative power in our spiritual journey. The story of the ten lepers, with only one returning to give thanks, speaks volumes about the human condition and our relationship with God.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>The Challenge of Gratitude:</strong> In our fast-paced world, it's easy to take blessings for granted. The nine lepers who didn't return represent our tendency to receive God's gifts without proper acknowledgment. This passage calls us to cultivate a heart of gratitude, recognizing that every blessing comes from God.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>The Samaritan's Example:</strong> The fact that it was a Samaritan who returned is significant. As an outsider, he perhaps had a deeper appreciation for Jesus' healing power. This reminds us that sometimes those on the margins of society have the clearest vision of God's mercy and love.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Practical Application:</strong> This week, let us make a conscious effort to return to Jesus in thanksgiving. Whether through daily prayer, the Sacrament of Reconciliation, or acts of service, we are called to be like the grateful Samaritan - recognizing God's hand in our lives and responding with heartfelt gratitude.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Prayer:</strong> Lord Jesus, like the grateful Samaritan, help us to recognize Your healing presence in our lives. Teach us to be people of gratitude, always returning to You with thankful hearts. May our lives be a continuous act of thanksgiving for Your infinite love and mercy. Amen.
