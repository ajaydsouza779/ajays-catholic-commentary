      content: `<p>In today's Gospel, we encounter a powerful story of gratitude and faith. Ten lepers approach Jesus, calling out for mercy. Jesus tells them to show themselves to the priests, and as they go, they are cleansed. However, only one returns to give thanks - a Samaritan, a foreigner.</p>

<p>This story teaches us several important lessons:</p>

  <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    <p>Pope Francis has often spoken about the importance of gratitude in our spiritual lives. He reminds us that gratitude is not just a feeling, but a way of life that opens our hearts to God's grace.</p>
    <p>In his homilies, the Holy Father emphasizes that when we are grateful, we recognize that everything we have comes from God. This recognition leads us to a deeper relationship with our Creator and a more compassionate heart towards others.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">ü§î My Personal Reflection</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    <p>I feel we have more to thank Jesus than the leper who was healed by Jesus. Jesus did have pity on us, and gave us himself - by becoming human (to see and imitate him), by sacrificing himself willingly on the Cross (for our sins for making justice happen) and in Holy Mass by becoming Eucharist (bread of life) for us.</p>
    <p>We as well as all the humanity should be grateful to Jesus, as he did to each and everyone what no-one, even the most loved one, can do - to be God and die as a friend. But not everyone knows what he did. And we who know may not remember that much as well.</p>
    <p>So may every Sunday, the Eucharist (which itself means thanksgiving too) be a reminder for us to do this. To thank Jesus for what he has done for us! May the faith in Jesus, save us.</p>

      Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus in our lives. Thank you Jesus for what you have done for us. Open my heart to recognize Your blessings in my life. Help me be like the Samaritan leper to acknowledge what you have done and to love and serve you. Amen.
