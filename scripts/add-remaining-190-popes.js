    biography: "Pope John XXII was one of the most influential popes of the Avignon period. Born Jacques Du√®ze in Cahors, France, he was a skilled canon lawyer and administrator. His papacy was marked by the consolidation of papal power in Avignon and significant theological controversies, particularly regarding the nature of Christ's poverty and the beatific vision. He established the papal court in Avignon, creating a sophisticated administrative system that would influence papal governance for centuries.",
    historicalContext: "John XXII's papacy occurred during the Avignon period (1309-1377), when the papacy was located in France rather than Rome. This period was marked by increased French influence over the Church and the development of a more centralized papal administration. The pope's theological controversies, particularly over the beatific vision and Franciscan poverty, reflected the intellectual ferment of the 14th century and the growing tension between papal authority and emerging theological movements.",
