      <p class="mb-4">As Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem, he traveled through Samaria and Galilee. As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance from him and raised their voice, saying, "Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!"</p>
      <p class="mb-4">And when he saw them, he said, "Go show yourselves to the priests." As they were going they were cleansed.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice. He fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Jesus said in reply, "Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?"</p>
      <p>Then he said to him, "Stand up and go; your faith has saved you."</p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>This Gospel passage takes place during Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem, a time when tensions between Jews and Samaritans were at their peak. The Samaritans were considered religious and ethnic outcasts by the Jews, making the grateful leper's return even more significant.</p>
        
        <p>Leprosy in biblical times was not just a physical ailment but a social and religious condition that excluded sufferers from community life. The ten lepers, regardless of their ethnic background, were united in their suffering and isolation.</p>

        <p>The healing of Naaman in the First Reading (2 Kings 5:14-17) provides a powerful parallel - both stories involve foreigners receiving God's healing grace and responding with faith and gratitude.</p>

        <p>Pope Francis has frequently emphasized the importance of gratitude in our spiritual lives. In his apostolic exhortation <em>Gaudete et Exsultate</em> (Rejoice and Be Glad), he writes:</p>
        
        <blockquote class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg italic text-gray-800">
          "The saints are not perfect images to be admired from afar, but people who lived their lives with gratitude to God, recognizing His gifts and responding with love. Gratitude opens our hearts to God's continued work in our lives."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Pope Francis also reminds us that gratitude is not just for the big moments but for the daily gifts we receive, encouraging us to develop a "culture of gratitude" in our families and communities.</p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        <p>I feel we have more to thank Jesus than the leaper who was healed by Jesus. Jesus did have pity on us, and gave us himself - by becoming human (to see and imitate him), by sacrificing himself willing on the Cross (for our sins for making justice happen) and in Holy Mass by becoming Eucharist (bread of life) for us.</p>
        
        <p>We as well as all the humanity should be grateful to Jesus, as he did to each and everyone what no-one, even the most loved one, can do - to be God and die as a friend. But not everyone knows what he did. And we who know may not remember that much has well.</p>
        
        <p>So may every Sunday, the Eucharist (which itself means thanksgiving too) be a reminder for us to do this. To thank Jesus for what he has done for us!</p>
        
        <p><strong>May the faith in Jesus, save us.</strong></p>
