        <p>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today''s Gospel presents us with a powerful lesson about gratitude and faith. Ten lepers were healed, but only one‚Äîa foreigner, a Samaritan‚Äîreturned to give thanks. This story challenges us to examine our own hearts.

I feel we have more to thank Jesus than the leper who was healed by Jesus. Jesus did have pity on us, and gave us himself - by becoming human (to see and imitate him), by sacrificing himself willingly on the Cross (for our sins for making justice happen) and in Holy Mass by becoming Eucharist (bread of life) for us.

We as well as all the humanity should be grateful to Jesus, as he did to each and everyone what no-one, even the most loved one, can do - to be God and die as a friend. But not everyone knows what he did. And we who know may not remember that much as well. 

So may every Sunday, the Eucharist (which itself means thanksgiving too) be a reminder for us to do this. To thank Jesus for what he has done for us!

May the faith in Jesus, save us.

How often do we receive God''s blessings and fail to acknowledge them? Like the nine lepers who went on their way, we might be so focused on our own concerns that we forget to return to the source of our healing and joy.

The Samaritan''s gratitude was not just a polite "thank you"‚Äîit was a recognition of Jesus as Lord and Savior. His faith was complete: he believed in Jesus'' power to heal, and he believed in Jesus'' authority to save. This is why Jesus said, "Your faith has saved you."

In our own lives, we are constantly receiving God''s grace: the gift of life, family, friends, daily bread, and most importantly, the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ. Do we take these gifts for granted, or do we return to give thanks?</p>
