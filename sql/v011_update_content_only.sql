    The story of the ten lepers always strikes me with its profound simplicity and challenging message. It''s easy to identify with the nine who, once healed, went on their way. We often do the same, don''t we? We pray fervently in times of need, promising devotion, but once the crisis passes, our gratitude can wane. The Samaritan, however, reminds us that true healing isn''t just physical; it''s spiritual. His return to Jesus, his act of worship, signifies a deeper understanding of the gift he received and the Giver. It''s a call to constant remembrance and thanksgiving, not just for what God does, but for who He is. This week, I''m challenged to pause more often and genuinely thank God, not just for answered prayers, but for His constant presence and unwavering love, even in the mundane.

    I feel we have more to thank Jesus than the leaper who was healed by Jesus. Jesus did have pity on us, and gave us himself - by becoming human (to see and imitate him), by sacrificing himself willing on the Cross (for our sins for making justice happen) and in Holy Mass by becoming Eucharist (bread of life) for us.

    We as well as all the humanity should be grateful to Jesus, as he did to each and everyone what no-one, even the most loved one, can do - to be God and die as a friend. But not everyone knows what he did. And we who know may not remember that much has well. 

    So may every Sunday, the Eucharist (which itself means thanksgiving too) be a reminder for us to do this. To thank Jesus for what he has done for us!

    May the faith in Jesus, save us.
