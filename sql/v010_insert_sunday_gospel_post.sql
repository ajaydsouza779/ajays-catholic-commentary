      <p class="mb-4">As Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem, he traveled through Samaria and Galilee. As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance from him and raised their voice, saying, "Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!"</p>
      <p class="mb-4">And when he saw them, he said, "Go show yourselves to the priests." As they were going they were cleansed.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice. He fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Jesus said in reply, "Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?"</p>
      <p>Then he said to him, "Stand up and go; your faith has saved you."</p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>This Gospel passage takes place during Jesus'' final journey to Jerusalem, a time when tensions between Jews and Samaritans were at their peak. The Samaritans were considered religious and ethnic outcasts by the Jews, making the grateful leper''s return even more significant.</p>
        <p>Leprosy in biblical times was not just a physical ailment but a social and religious condition that excluded sufferers from community life. The ten lepers, regardless of their ethnic background, were united in their suffering and isolation.</p>
        <p>The healing of Naaman in the First Reading (2 Kings 5:14-17) provides a powerful parallel - both stories involve foreigners receiving God''s healing grace and responding with faith and gratitude.</p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Pope Francis has frequently emphasized the importance of gratitude in our spiritual lives. In his apostolic exhortation <em>Gaudete et Exsultate</em> (Rejoice and Be Glad), he writes:</p>
        <blockquote class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-gray-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg italic text-gray-800">
          "The saints are not perfect images to be admired from afar, but people who lived their lives with gratitude to God, recognizing His gifts and responding with love. Gratitude opens our hearts to God''s continued work in our lives."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Pope Francis also reminds us that gratitude is not just for the big moments but for the daily gifts we receive, encouraging us to develop a "culture of gratitude" in our families and communities.</p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,</p>
        <p>Today''s Gospel presents us with a powerful lesson about gratitude and faith. Ten lepers were healed, but only one‚Äîa foreigner, a Samaritan‚Äîreturned to give thanks. This story challenges us to examine our own hearts.</p>
        <p><strong>How often do we receive God''s blessings and fail to acknowledge them?</strong> Like the nine lepers who went on their way, we might be so focused on our own concerns that we forget to return to the source of our healing and joy.</p>
        <p>The Samaritan''s gratitude was not just a polite "thank you"‚Äîit was a recognition of Jesus as Lord and Savior. His faith was complete: he believed in Jesus'' power to heal, and he believed in Jesus'' authority to save. This is why Jesus said, "Your faith has saved you."</p>
        <p>In our own lives, we are constantly receiving God''s grace: the gift of life, family, friends, daily bread, and most importantly, the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ. Do we take these gifts for granted, or do we return to give thanks?</p>

      This Gospel passage invites us to reflect on the profound nature of gratitude and its transformative power in our spiritual journey. The story of the ten lepers, with only one returning to give thanks, speaks volumes about the human condition and our relationship with God.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>The Challenge of Gratitude:</strong> In our fast-paced world, it''s easy to take blessings for granted. The nine lepers who didn''t return represent our tendency to receive God''s gifts without proper acknowledgment. This passage calls us to cultivate a heart of gratitude, recognizing that every blessing comes from God.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>The Samaritan''s Example:</strong> The fact that it was a Samaritan who returned is significant. As an outsider, he perhaps had a deeper appreciation for Jesus'' healing power. This reminds us that sometimes those on the margins of society have the clearest vision of God''s mercy and love.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Practical Application:</strong> This week, let us make a conscious effort to return to Jesus in thanksgiving. Whether through daily prayer, the Sacrament of Reconciliation, or acts of service, we are called to be like the grateful Samaritan - recognizing God''s hand in our lives and responding with heartfelt gratitude.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
      <strong>Prayer:</strong> Lord Jesus, like the grateful Samaritan, help us to recognize Your healing presence in our lives. Teach us to be people of gratitude, always returning to You with thankful hearts. May our lives be a continuous act of thanksgiving for Your infinite love and mercy. Amen.
