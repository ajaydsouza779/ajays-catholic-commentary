Jesus did have pity on us, and gave us himself - by becoming human (to see and imitate him), by sacrificing himself willing on the Cross (for our sins for making justice happen) and in Holy Mass by becoming Eucharist (bread of life) for us.

We as well as all the humanity should be grateful to Jesus, as he did to each and everyone what no-one, even the most loved one, can do - to be God and die as a friend. But not everyone knows what he did. And we who know may not remember that much has well. 

So may every Sunday, the Eucharist (which itself means thanksgiving too) be a reminder for us to do this. To thank Jesus for what he has done for us!

May the faith in Jesus, save us.',

    Heavenly Father, I thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus in our lives. Thank you Jesus for what you have done for us.
    Open my heart to recognize Your blessings in my life. Help me be like the Samaritan leper to acknowledge what you have done and to love and serve you. Amen.
