## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Tiptap** for rich text editing
- **NextAuth.js** for authentication

### Backend Stack
- **Next.js API Routes** for server-side logic
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations
- **SQLite** for local development
- **JWT sessions** for authentication

### Database Schema
```prisma
// Core Models
User -> Posts (1:many)
User -> Comments (1:many)
Posts -> Categories (many:many via PostCategory)
Posts -> Tags (many:many via PostTag)
SiteSettings -> Admin content (profile photos, etc.)

// History Models
Pope -> PapalEvent (1:many)
Pope -> PapalAchievement (1:many)
Pope -> ChurchDivision (many:many via PopeDivisions)
ChurchDivision -> ChurchDivision (self-referencing for hierarchy)
BibleManuscript (standalone)
BibleTranslation (standalone)
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in with email/password
2. NextAuth.js validates credentials against database
3. JWT token created with user role
4. Session stored and used for API authorization

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Current Phase**: Issue Resolution & Testing  
**Next Milestone**: All Tests Passing

## UI-First Working Agreement (Session Expectations)
- Focus order: Homepage UI first, then other pages.
- Apply a cohesive theme: contrasting header (white), body (neutral-50), and footer (white), avoid full-cream everywhere.
- Keep links compact (inline-flex), avoid oversized blocks; consistent padding/gaps.
- Validate visually: take homepage screenshots after changes; tests are secondary to visual checks for UI tasks.
- Progress cadence: post a short status update at least every 5 minutes during long tasks.
- Prefer minimal, reversible edits; document changes briefly in commits/notes.

### Live Progress Logging
- During any long-running work (builds, tests, data tasks, multi-file edits), the assistant must emit a brief console-style status update every ‚â§5 minutes indicating:
  - What step is in progress
  - What was just completed
  - Any blockers or waits (e.g., network/build)
  - Next immediate action

### Deferred UI Elements (Reminders)
- Homepage hero (author photo, name, intro text and CTAs) is temporarily hidden. Restore this section later when content is ready and styling is finalized.
